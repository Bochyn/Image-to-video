## Basic model info

Model name: black-forest-labs/flux-kontext-pro
Model description: A state-of-the-art text-based image editing model that delivers high-quality outputs with excellent prompt following and consistent results for transforming images through natural language


## Model inputs

- prompt: Text description of what you want to generate, or the instruction on how to edit the given image. (string)
- input_image: Image to use as reference. Must be jpeg, png, gif, or webp. (string)
- aspect_ratio: Aspect ratio of the generated image. Use 'match_input_image' to match the aspect ratio of the input image. (string)
- seed: Random seed. Set for reproducible generation (integer)
- output_format: Output format for the generated image (string)
- safety_tolerance: Safety tolerance, 0 is most strict and 6 is most permissive. 2 is currently the maximum allowed when input images are used. (integer)


## Model output schema

{
  "type": "string",
  "title": "Output",
  "format": "uri"
}

If the input or output schema includes a format of URI, it is referring to a file.


## Example inputs and outputs

Use these example outputs to better understand the types of inputs the model accepts, and the types of outputs the model returns:

> ## What You Can Do
> 
> Kontext excels at:
> 
> - **Style Transfer**: Convert photos to different art styles (watercolor, oil painting, sketches)
> - **Object/Clothing Changes**: Modify hairstyles, add accessories, change colors
> - **Text Editing**: Replace text in signs, posters, and labels
> - **Background Swapping**: Change environments while preserving subjects
> - **Character Consistency**: Maintain identity across multiple edits
> 
> ## Prompting Best Practices
> 
> ### Be Specific
> 
> - Use clear, detailed language with exact colors and descriptions
> - Avoid vague terms like "make it better"
> - Name subjects directly: "the woman with short black hair" vs. "she"
> 
> ### Preserve Intentionally
> 
> - Specify what should stay the same: "while keeping the same facial features"
> - Use "maintain the original composition" to preserve layout
> - For background changes: "Change the background to a beach while keeping the person in the exact same position"
> 
> ### Text Editing Tips
> 
> - Use quotation marks: "replace 'old text' with 'new text'"
> - Stick to readable fonts
> - Match text length when possible to preserve layout
> 
> ### Style Transfer
> 
> - Be specific about artistic styles: "impressionist painting" not "artistic"
> - Reference known movements: "Renaissance" or "1960s pop art"
> - Describe key traits: "visible brushstrokes, thick paint texture"
> 
> ### Complex Edits
> 
> - Break into smaller steps for better results
> - Start simple and iterate
> - Use descriptive action verbs instead of "transform" for more control
> 
> ## Commercial Use
> 
> When using FLUX.1 Kontext on Replicate, you're free to use outputs commercially in apps, marketing, or any business use.
> 
> ## Example Applications
> 
> Check out these [specialized apps](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps) built with Kontext:
> 
> - [Portrait series](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/portrait-series): Generate portrait variations from a single image
> - [Change haircut](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/change-haircut): Modify hairstyles and colors

> - [Professional headshot](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/professional-headshot): Create professional portraits
> 
> ## Tips Summary
> 
> - **Be specific** with colors, styles, and descriptions
> - **Start simple** and iterate on successful edits
> - **Preserve intentionally** by stating what to keep unchanged
> - **Use quotation marks** for exact text replacements
> - **Control composition** by specifying camera angles and framing
> - **Choose verbs carefully** - "change" vs "transform" gives different results
